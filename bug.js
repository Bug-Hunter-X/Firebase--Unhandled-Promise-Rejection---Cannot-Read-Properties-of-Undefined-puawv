The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This often happens when using asynchronous functions and not properly handling promises or callbacks. For example, if you call a method on a document snapshot inside an asynchronous function before the data has finished loading, you could get an error like 'Unhandled promise rejection TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')'.
